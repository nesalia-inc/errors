# 0013 — Entity-First Naming: Refuse Bare `-er` Suffixes

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

A class, type, or module name is **never** a bare job title. The
suffixes `Manager`, `Service`, `Handler`, `Controller`, `Helper`,
`Writer`, `Reader`, `Converter`, `Validator`, `Router`,
`Dispatcher`, `Observer`, `Listener`, `Sorter`, `Encoder`,
`Decoder`, and every other `-er` ending that names what the thing
**does for the caller** rather than what the thing **is** —
are refused as standalone names.

The rule is against suffixes as **the only content of a name** AND
against suffixes that survive qualification. A `Handler` is refused
because the name says only that something is being handled; a
`CancelOrderHandler` is also refused, because the suffix still
describes the **role the thing plays in someone else's code**,
not the thing itself. The qualifier does not change the smell; it
only makes the smell larger and harder to spot.

Two patterns, in increasing order of severity:

- **Suffix as name content** (`Manager`, `Service`, `Handler`,
  `CancelOrderHandler`, `UserCreationService`) — refused. The
  suffix is part of the name, with or without a qualifier. The
  name describes a role, not an entity.
- **Entity name** (`SortedApples`, `ValidatedPayload`,
  `CancellationRequest`) — the only accepted shape. The name
  describes what the thing **is**, not what it does for the
  caller.

The rule accepts the entity shape only. The suffix shape, with
or without a qualifier, is the smell this rule exists to catch.

## Why

A bare job title is a confession that the author could not name
the thing they were building. The thing exists; the author wrote
it. But the name they gave it is the name of the **role the thing
plays in someone else's code**, not the name of the thing itself.
The author outsourced the naming to the caller.

This is the same anti-pattern as a function called `doStuff`,
applied at the type level. The reader who meets the type for the
first time cannot tell what it represents, only what it does for
the system that uses it. The reader has to read the callers to
recover the entity, when the name should have done that work.

The deeper problem is **diffusion of responsibility**. A class
named `Manager` is a class to which any method can be added
without breaking its name. A class named `OrderCancellationService`
is a class to which only order-cancellation methods can be added
without breaking its name. The first grows; the second stays
focal. The smell is not aesthetic; it is a measurement of how
much scope a class is allowed to absorb.

## What this looks like in violation

The first shape, bare job title:

```ts
// Bad — what does this manage?
class UserManager {
  createUser(input: CreateUserInput): User {
    /* ... */
  }
  updateUser(id: string, input: UpdateUserInput): User {
    /* ... */
  }
  deleteUser(id: string): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  authenticateUser(credentials: Credentials): Session {
    /* ... */
  }
  sendPasswordResetEmail(email: string): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  generateUserReport(filters: ReportFilters): Report {
    /* ... */
  }
  // ... and so on, indefinitely.
}
```

Six unrelated responsibilities under one name. The next contributor
who adds a method asks "where does it go?" and the answer is
"UserManager". The class grows until it is unmanageable.

The second shape, qualified job title, is the shape the rule
**refuses**. It is mentioned here only because it is what most
codebases reach for as the "smaller" compromise:

```ts
// Refused — the suffix still describes a role, not an entity.
// The qualifier makes the smell larger, not smaller.
class OrderCancellationHandler {
  handle(command: CancelOrderCommand): CancellationResult {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

The qualifier does not turn a role into an entity. The class is
still named for what it does for the caller (`Handler`), not for
what it is. A reader who meets `OrderCancellationHandler` learns
that there is a handler; they still have to read the body to
discover that the handler is the cancellation.

The right shape:

```ts
// The name describes what the thing is.
// The class stays internal — see rule 0014.
class OrderCancellation {
  cancel(command: CancelOrderCommand): CancellationResult {
    /* ... */
  }
}

// Or, more idiomatic in functional code:
type OrderCancellation = (command: CancelOrderCommand) => CancellationResult;
```

The class is the **thing**; the method is the **operation on the
thing**. The reader does not need to know who is using it. _The
class above is internal; rule 0014 forbids exporting it. The
public shape is a factory function (`createOrderCancellation`)
or, more often, a type alias and a free function. The example
here shows the naming pattern; rule 0014 shows the public-API
pattern._

## When the rule does not apply

The rule applies to **shape names** — the name of a class, a type,
a module, a service handle. It does not apply to:

- **Variable names** that hold an instance briefly. `const
manager = new OrderCancellationHandler();` is acceptable; the
  variable is scoped to one expression and the type name carries
  the focal responsibility.
- **Test names**. `UserManagerTest` is acceptable as a test class
  name when the type under test is `UserManager`; the test name
  mirrors the type name. Refusing the test name would create a
  useless indirection.
- **Build-time tooling**. Generated code, vendor bindings, and
  frameworks where the shape is fixed by the other side.

## How to refactor a suffix-bearing name

When a contributor has written `Manager`, `Service`, `Handler`,
or any qualified version (`CancelOrderHandler`,
`UserCreationService`), the refactor has two steps, in order:

1. **Identify the entity.** The class is doing something for the
   caller. The thing it operates on, or the thing it **is**, is
   the entity. A `CancelOrderHandler` is the cancellation; the
   qualifier already names it. A `UserCreationService` is the user
   creation; the qualifier already names it. The entity is in
   the qualifier; the suffix is what is removed.
2. **Rename to the entity, drop the suffix.**
   `CancelOrderHandler` → `OrderCancellation`. `UserCreationService`
   → `UserCreation`. The method on the entity is the action
   (`cancel`, `create`).

There is no "smallest change" path that keeps the suffix. The
suffix is the smell; removing it is the change. If the class is
too small to deserve its own entity name, the qualifier is
replaced by the action: `cancelOrder(command: CancelOrderCommand)`
is a function on the `OrderCancellationService` — but the function
itself does not need a wrapper class; it is a function.

The refactor in three steps when the class is large enough:

1. Split into one entity per focal responsibility.
2. Each entity exposes one operation (`cancel`, `create`,
   `validate`).
3. The suffix goes away with the wrapper class.

## What this looks like in violation — the focused case

A class that has the right name but the wrong shape:

```ts
// Bad — the name says one thing, the methods do many.
class OrderCancellation {
  cancel(command: CancelOrderCommand): CancellationResult {
    /* ... */
  }
  refund(orderId: string, amount: Money): RefundResult {
    /* ... */
  }
  notifyCustomer(orderId: string): void {
    /* ... */
  }
  generateCancellationReport(filters: ReportFilters): Report {
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

The name promises one responsibility; the body delivers four.
The right move is to split. Each method becomes its own entity
or its own command. The class `OrderCancellation` then has only
the `cancel` method; the others live in their own types.

Bugayenko's diagnosis is the philosophical ground of the rule.
A bare job title is a class that has no entity to be; it is a
collection of procedures that the caller orchestrates. The shape
exists; the entity does not.

Muc's observation operationalises Bugayenko. The suffix is a
proxy measurement for responsibility count. When the suffix is
necessary, the count is high.

Lavoie quantifies the cost. A bare `Service` accumulates methods
faster than it accumulates tests. The total cost of the class is
the methods times the tests; the suffix makes the cost invisible.

Bogard's position is the most permissive of the four sources. The
rule does not follow Bogard; the rule follows Bugayenko. The
qualifier-plus-suffix shape Bogard recommends is, in this rule's
reading, still a role-naming convention: `CancelOrderHandler`
tells the reader what the thing does for the caller, not what
the thing is. The rule's stance is that a class which is
described by what it does for the caller should be a function
on the entity it operates on, not a wrapper class. The
qualifier is the entity; the suffix is the wrapper.

The four voices still converge on the **diagnosis** — the suffix
is a smell — even when they disagree on the **threshold**. The
rule picks the strictest threshold: no suffix, with or without a
qualifier. The other positions describe intermediate shapes
project contributors may reach for during a refactor; the rule
captures the shape the project is moving toward.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a bare `-er` suffix in a
  class or type name (`UserManager`, `PaymentService`,
  `EventHandler`) blocks the PR and asks for a qualifier, a split,
  or an entity rename.
- **Naming audit**. A standing review of "which classes in this
  codebase have a bare `-er` suffix?" surfaces the candidates that
  slipped through. Each is a refactor candidate, not a backlog
  item.
- **Lint rule** (future). A custom ESLint rule can flag bare
  `-er` suffixes in class and type declarations. The rule's
  existence is the enforcement signal even before it is automated.

## Exceptions

A test class name (`UserManagerTest`) is permitted because it
mirrors the type under test. The test class is not the entity; it
is the verification of the entity. Renaming `UserManagerTest` to
`UserTest` while the type under test is still `UserManager` would
create a useless indirection; the rename is the responsibility of
the type rename, not the test rename.

A variable that holds an instance briefly (`const manager = ...`)
is permitted. The type name carries the focal responsibility; the
variable name is local. The rule refuses type names, not
variable names.

Build-time tooling, generated code, vendor bindings, and
frameworks where the shape is fixed by the other side are
permitted. The rule applies to code the project writes, not to
code the project consumes.

- **Rule 0011** — Filenames Are kebab-case: a class named
  `UserManager` usually lives in a file named `user-manager.ts`,
