# 0008 — No Chained Type Assertions

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

A type assertion may appear at most once in a single expression.
The shapes `as X as Y`, `as unknown as Y`, and any sequence of two or
more assertions are forbidden.

A single assertion is allowed when it crosses exactly one type
boundary: augmenting a host type the consumer controls, narrowing a
`unknown` from a documented boundary (an IPC, a deserialised value, a
foreign-realm object), or asserting the runtime shape of a value the
type system cannot describe.

A chained assertion is not an assertion. It is a confession that the
author has lost the thread of the type and is reaching for the
escape hatch twice in a row to make the compiler stop complaining.
The compiler is right to complain. The fix is not a longer cast; the
fix is a better type.

## Why

A single assertion documents a contract: "I know this value is of
type X, even though the type system does not." The reader can audit
the contract once.

A chained assertion documents nothing. The intermediate `unknown`
or `as X` erases the reasoning between the source type and the
target type. The reader cannot audit what was assumed; they can
only see that two casts were stacked, and assume the author had a
reason. Often the author did not.

The compiler is not the enemy. When the compiler rejects an
assertion, it is pointing at a real ambiguity in the code. A chained
cast papers over the ambiguity instead of resolving it. The code
compiles, but the type contract is now fictional.

## What the rule forbids

- `value as A as B` — two assertions in one expression.
- `value as unknown as B` — the explicit "I give up" double cast.
- `value as unknown as unknown as B` and longer chains.
- The functional equivalent in generics: `(value as Foo<T>).bar as Baz<T>`.
- `as` casts that target a type that requires another `as` to
  construct. If the right-hand side is not reachable in one cast,
  the right-hand side is the wrong target.

## What the rule allows

- A single `value as T` where `T` is reachable from the source type
  by one explicit widening or narrowing the author can name.
- A single `value as unknown` followed by **structural work** that
  produces a new value, not a second cast. Example:
  `value as unknown; if (!isShape(value)) throw ...; return value as
Shape;` is acceptable because the work between the two
  occurrences is a runtime guard, not another assertion.
- Augmentation of host types with `declare module` to teach the type
  system about a property the runtime provides. This is a
  declaration, not an assertion.

## How to fix a chained cast

When the compiler forces you to write `value as X as Y`, the right
fix is one of three, in order of preference:

1. **Use a runtime guard that produces the type the compiler
   expects.** A function that takes `unknown` and returns `T | null`
   removes the cast at the call site: `const typed = toShape(value);
if (typed === null) throw ...;`. The compiler narrows after the
   guard; the assertion disappears.

2. **Change the source type.** If `value` is typed too narrowly to
   cast to `Y`, the source type is the bug. Widen the source by
   making the function that produces it return a more precise type,
   or by accepting `unknown` at the boundary.

3. **Add a typed accessor.** If the chain exists because the
   consumer has to reach into a host object, write a function
   `getFactorySymbol(error: unknown): ErrorFactory | undefined` that
   hides the cast inside a named operation. Callers stop casting;
   the cast lives in one named place that can be reviewed.

The rule is not "no casts ever". The rule is "if a cast crosses two
boundaries, you have not understood what you are doing. Stop and
ask what the cast is for."

## What this looks like in violation

Two patterns that this rule exists to catch. Each is shown bad
then good.

**The first, common — chained cast on a value the author controls:**

```ts
// Bad — the author could have typed `instance` correctly from the start.
const instance = new Error(message) as unknown as Record<typeof FACTORY_SYMBOL, () => unknown>;
instance[FACTORY_SYMBOL] = ErrorFactoryInstance;
```

The cast is two-level. The first `as unknown` erases the `Error`
type. The second `as Record<...>` reinvents a type that does not
exist. The author could have declared `instance` as
`ErrorInstance<T>` from the start and assigned the symbol via the
declared property — no cast needed.

```ts
// Good — the constructor's return type carries the right shape; the
// property assignment goes through the declared type.
const instance = new Error(message) as ErrorInstance<T>;
instance[FACTORY_SYMBOL] = ErrorFactoryInstance;
```

One cast. The cast crosses one boundary (the `Error` constructor
returns a base `Error`, not the augmented `ErrorInstance<T>`). The
property assignment is on the declared type, not a re-invented
shape.

**The second, defensive — single cast at the wrong layer:**

```ts
// Bad — the cast is one level, but it is in business logic, not at a boundary.
const marker = error as Record<typeof FACTORY_SYMBOL, unknown>;
const factory = marker[FACTORY_SYMBOL];
```

The cast is in business logic. The `error` value crossed no IPC,
no deserialisation boundary, no foreign realm. The cast is a leak
of internal knowledge into the call site.

```ts
// Good — the cast lives inside a named accessor that is the only
// place it appears.
const factory = getFactory(error);
```

Where `getFactory` returns `ErrorFactory | undefined` and the cast
lives inside it. The cast is now at a named boundary; the business
logic is honest about what it knows.

## The positive example — when a single cast is correct

A single cast crossing **one** named boundary is allowed. Example:

```ts
// Good — the cast crosses one boundary: the JSON parse returned a
// value of unknown shape; the guard below narrows without a second
// cast.
const raw = JSON.parse(payload) as unknown;
if (!isShape(raw)) {
  throw new InvalidPayloadError(payload);
}
return raw;
```

One cast, one boundary. The guard below the cast does the structural
work. If the guard is missing, this is a violation of rule 0004 (no
speculative defences), not a violation of rule 0008. The two rules
compound cleanly: a cast at a boundary without a guard is 0004's
smell; a chain of casts is 0008's smell.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees two casts in one expression
  blocks the PR. The fix is one of the three patterns above, not a
  comment justifying the chain.
- **Lint rule**. A future ESLint rule (`@typescript-eslint/no-duplicate-type-assertions`)
  or a custom one can flag the pattern mechanically. The rule's
  existence is the enforcement signal even before it is automated.
- **Self-review**. Before opening a PR, the author searches the diff
  for `as` and counts the assertions per expression. Any
  expression with more than one is rewritten before submission.

## Exceptions

A pattern that crosses a documented IPC, deserialisation, or
foreign-realm boundary may legitimately require a single `unknown`
cast on the receiving side. The cast must be at the boundary, not
deeper in the call chain. If the cast moves into business logic, it
is no longer a boundary cast and is forbidden.

## What senior practitioners say

The rule is not a stylistic preference; it is the operational
form of a position shared by senior TypeScript practitioners. Three
sources capture the consensus:

> "Casting like this takes away TypeScript's power because you are
> now telling it what to believe rather than the tooling basing
> that belief on logic, inference, etc."
>
> — Darryl Edwards, _TypeScript – don't misuse casting_, Code
> Krispies, June 2024.

Edwards's point is that `as unknown as Y` is not a workaround; it
is the abdication of the type system's job. The author is
substituting their own reasoning for the compiler's reasoning,
and the compiler can no longer help. The reasoning that was lost
is the reasoning the reader would have benefited from.

> "When we use type assertion we are basically telling the
> TypeScript compiler that we know what the type is and it should
> trust us, i.e. we know what we are doing. The problem with this
> is that we prevent TypeScript from helping us where it should
> and take on that responsibility ourselves."
>
> — Maina Wycliffe, _Avoid using Type Assertions in TypeScript_,
> All Things TypeScript, October 2023.

Wycliffe makes the responsibility transfer explicit. The cast
is a contract: "I, the author, am now responsible for this
type." The reader inherits that responsibility when they touch
the code. A cast at a boundary is a documented contract; a cast in
business logic is an undocumented one.

> "Any external data has an `unknown` type by default until it is
> inferred."
>
> — Anton Beluzhenko, _Why `as unknown as Type` should be banned_,
> JavaScript in Plain English, April 2024.

Beluzhenko frames the legitimate case. A value at a boundary is
`unknown` by definition — the contract is that the next step is
inference (via a guard, a parser, or a schema). The cast
`as unknown` at the boundary is honest; the cast `as unknown as Y`
at the same boundary is dishonest because it skips the inference
step that the boundary demands.

The three sources converge on a single operational rule: a single
cast is acceptable at a boundary, paired with a guard; a chain of
casts is never acceptable. This rule is the operational form of
that position.

  casts at a boundary without a guard. The two rules compound:
  a cast at a boundary without a guard is 0004's smell; a chain
  of casts is 0008's smell.
- **Rule 0012** — Prefer `type` Over `interface`: the type
  discipline this rule relies on. A `type` declaration that
  requires a cast to use is a violation of 0008; the declaration is
  the wrong shape.
