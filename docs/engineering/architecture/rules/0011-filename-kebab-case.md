# 0011 — Filenames Are kebab-case

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review and CI lint).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Every file in this repository is named in **kebab-case**: lowercase
letters, digits, and hyphens. No spaces, no underscores, no
uppercase, no camelCase, no PascalCase.

The rule applies to:

- Source files (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`).
- Test files.
- Configuration files (when the tool allows the name).
- Documentation files (`.md`, `.mdx`).
- Directory names.
- Asset filenames.

The rule applies to **filenames**. The contents of a file are free
to use whatever convention the language requires: a `.ts` file may
export `PascalCaseComponent`, a `.tsx` file may declare
`PascalCaseComponents`. The boundary is the name on disk.

## Why

A consistent filename convention removes a category of decisions
that the contributor does not need to make. Every commit, every PR,
every grep, every file-listing in a tool reads the same way. The
casing of a file tells the reader nothing about its content, but
the **inconsistency** of casing tells the reader that someone made
a choice that did not need to be made.

Kebab-case is chosen because:

- It is the convention the broader JavaScript ecosystem uses for
  filesystem names (Next.js, Vite, many build tools emit kebab-case
  routes by default).
- It survives cross-platform case-insensitive filesystems (macOS,
  Windows) without ambiguity. A file named `ErrorFactory.ts` and
  one named `errorFactory.ts` are the same file on a case-insensitive
  filesystem.
- It composes with the file-separation rule (0002) and the
  file-placement rule (0003): a concern folder reads as a list of
  kebab-case nouns, each describing what the file does.

## What the rule forbids

- **camelCase**: `errorFactory.ts`, `errorHandler.ts`.
- **PascalCase**: `ErrorFactory.ts`, `ErrorHandler.ts`. Even if the
  file exports a `PascalCase` symbol, the filename stays kebab-case.
- **snake_case**: `error_factory.ts`. Underscores are forbidden.
- **Mixed case in one file**: `Error-factory.ts` is not kebab-case.
- **Uppercase abbreviations**: `URLParser.ts` becomes `url-parser.ts`.

## What the rule allows

- **Numbers** in the filename, between hyphens: `http2-server.ts`,
  `error-codes-1.ts`. Numbers are part of the name, not a separator.
- **Version-style numbers without hyphens**: `v2-handler.ts` is
  fine; `v2handler.ts` is not.
- **Test files** that match the source file they test with a
  `.test.ts` suffix: `error-factory.ts` is tested by
  `error-factory.test.ts`. The base name stays kebab-case.
- **Index files**: `index.ts` is the single exception. It is the
  convention every bundler, every import path, and every language
  module system recognises. The filename `index.ts` is a
  vocabulary word, not a casing choice.
- **Filesystem-mandated names**: `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`,
  `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`. These names
  are dictated by the tools that consume them, not by the project.
  They are not subject to the rule.
- **Documentation files in this very rules folder**: the rules
  themselves use `NNNN-kebab-case-slug.md` as filenames, including
  the digit prefix and the kebab-case slug. The rule applies to its
  own naming; the rule does not exempt itself.

## How to fix a wrong-cased filename

When you rename a file to fix its case, two things happen:

1. The file appears as a deletion and an addition in `git status`
   even though the content is unchanged. This is correct: git tracks
   case-sensitive differences on case-insensitive filesystems.
2. Imports of the file (if any) must be updated in the same PR.
   Stale imports will not compile.

A rename PR is therefore one commit that:

- Renames the file with `git mv` (or equivalent).
- Updates every import site in the same commit.
- Runs the test suite to confirm nothing is broken.

If the file is renamed multiple times across the history, a `git
log --diff-filter=R` can surface the rename chain. The current
filename is what the rule cares about; history is not rewritten.

## What this looks like in violation

Three shapes that this rule exists to catch.

The first, common:

```
src/
├── errorFactory.ts       # camelCase
├── ErrorHandler.ts       # PascalCase
└── error_factory.ts      # snake_case
```

Three files, three conventions, all in the same directory. A reader
who greps for `error` sees hits in three different cases; their
mental model has to track which is which.

The second, mixed:

```
src/
├── apiClient.ts          # camelCase
├── http-client.ts        # kebab-case
├── HttpServer.ts         # PascalCase
└── http_server.ts        # snake_case
```

The same project, four files, four conventions. Each was probably
written by a different author at a different time. The drift tells
the reader that no one is reading the existing names before adding
new ones.

The third, case-insensitive-filesystem trap:

A file `ErrorFactory.ts` is created on macOS or Windows. The next
contributor, on Linux, creates `errorFactory.ts`. Git tracks both.
On macOS, the second contributor sees only one file because the
filesystem sees them as the same. The merge conflict appears only
when someone tries to checkout on Linux. The fix is to enforce
kebab-case at the rule level so the trap is impossible to enter.

**Bad** — three folders, three conventions, same project:

```
src/
├── errorFactory/        # camelCase
│   └── index.ts
├── ErrorHandler/        # PascalCase
│   └── index.ts
└── http_client/         # snake_case
    └── index.ts
```

A grep for `error` returns hits in three different cases. A file
listing reads as three unrelated projects. The reader's mental model
has to track which casing means which.

**Good** — one folder per concern, kebab-case throughout:

```
src/
├── error-factory/       # kebab-case
│   └── index.ts
├── error-handler/       # kebab-case
│   └── index.ts
└── http-client/         # kebab-case
    └── index.ts
```

A grep for `error` returns hits in one case. A file listing reads
as one project. The reader's mental model is uniform; the casing
does not need to be learned.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a non-kebab-case filename
  blocks the PR. The fix is `git mv`, not "I'll fix it later".
- **CI lint** (existing). The existing lint workflows catch
  obvious casing inconsistencies in the diff. The rule is the
  review-time signal that those catches are doing real work.
- **Quarterly audit**. A standing review of "which files in this
  repo have non-kebab-case names?" surfaces the candidates that
  slipped through. Each is a one-commit rename PR.

## Exceptions

The exceptions are **vocabulary words, not casing choices**:

- `index.ts` in any directory.
- Tool-mandated names: `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`, `.editorconfig`,
  `.prettierignore`, `.eslintrc.*`, `.husky`, `.lintstagedrc.*`,
  `tsconfig*.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `next.config.*`,
  `package.json`, `pnpm-*.yaml`, `.changeset/*.md` (changeset
  filenames are dictated by the changesets tool).
- Branded filenames that the tool requires (none today; revisit if
  one shows up).

The exceptions are listed because a reviewer should know what is
not subject to the rule. They are not loopholes; they are
constraints from tools the project depends on.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own working
experience. The casing choice (kebab-case) is the convention
the broader JavaScript ecosystem follows (Next.js, Vite, most
build tools emit kebab-case routes by default); the rule is
not anchored to a single external reference because the
convention is universal enough that citing one would imply the
others are wrong. The case-insensitive-filesystem trap is a
Git behaviour; the rule documents the failure mode without
attributing it.
