# 0003 — File Placement: Decide Before You Create

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Every new file or directory is created **after** a deliberate decision
about where it belongs. The decision is made before the file is
written, not justified after.

Concretely:

1. Before creating the file, the author states (in the PR description,
   in the commit body, or in code review) **why** this file lives
   here and not somewhere else. "It felt right" is not a justification.
2. If the file holds a single function, the default placement is **next
   to its sole caller**, in the caller's concern folder. It is not a
   "common utility" until there are at least two callers in different
   concerns.
3. If the file is a candidate for "common utils", the author must
   demonstrate the **second use site** before extracting. Until then,
   the duplication is the cheaper choice.

## Why

The instinct to drop a helper into a shared `utils.ts` (or to create a
`utils.ts` to host it) is an act of **premature centralisation**. The
function feels reusable, so we put it where "everyone can find it".
Two months later, the function has one caller, the file is the
graveyard of half-finished ideas, and the next contributor adds their
own helper next to it without reading the first one. Six months later,
the file has seventeen unrelated helpers and no shared concept.

The cost of misplacing a file grows faster than the cost of a single
duplicate. A duplicate is at worst two lines that say the same thing
in two places; a misplaced file is a wrong contract that the rest of
the codebase imports.

The discipline of "decide before you create" forces the author to
think about the **lifetime** of the file. A helper next to its caller
has the lifetime of the caller; a helper in `utils.ts` has the
lifetime of "everything". The shorter lifetime is the honest
contract.

## How to decide

Ask four questions, in order. Any "no" answers the question of whether
this file belongs at all.

1. **What concern does it serve?** If the answer is "only one
   concern", the file goes in that concern. If "two or more
   concerns", continue.
2. **Is the second use site already real?** Not "I imagine using
   this elsewhere". A real second use site: a different concern that
   already needs this function today. If the second site is
   speculative, keep the function near its first caller.
3. **Is the shared concept narrower than "utility"?** "Validation
   helpers" is a concept. "String utilities" is not. A concept-narrow
   module (`validation/helpers.ts`, `formatting/dates.ts`) ages
   better than a generic `utils/`.
4. **Does the name of the new file describe what it does?** A file
   named `helpers.ts`, `misc.ts`, `stuff.ts` is almost always wrong.
   A file named `date-formatter.ts`, `assert-never.ts`,
   `http-status.ts` describes its purpose and ages well.

### Thresholds at a glance

The codebase applies three different thresholds to three different
decisions. The thresholds are not interchangeable; each answers a
specific question.

| Decision                                          | Threshold           | Evidence required                                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Keep a helper inline with its single caller       | 1 caller            | The helper has no second consumer yet.           |
| Move a file to a shared location across concerns  | 2 distinct concerns | A second concern already needs the file.         |
| Introduce a generic abstraction (named algorithm) | 3 concrete cases    | The abstraction has paid for itself three times. |

The first row is the file-level default (rule 0005). The second row
is this rule's question 2. The third row is the _Rule of Three_
named in rule 0001 (invariant 4). A reader applying the
"second-caller" threshold of this rule to a _generic abstraction_
is using the wrong number; a reader applying the "three-cases"
threshold to a _file move_ is being over-cautious and accumulating
duplication the codebase has already paid for.

## When extraction is appropriate

A function moves to a shared location when:

- It is called from at least two distinct concerns.
- The concept the function represents is named (not "a thing that
  trims strings" but "an RFC 3986 percent-encoder").
- The signature is stable: no caller has needed to extend it with
  optional flags yet.

A constant moves to a shared location when:

- It is referenced from at least two concerns.
- It is a value the rest of the codebase would otherwise have to
  duplicate or hard-code.

A type moves to a shared location when:

- It is used as a contract by two or more concerns.
- The type is small and self-contained (no cross-cutting dependencies).

## What this looks like in violation

The smell that this rule exists to catch:

```
src/
├── utils/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── date.ts        # only used by report formatter
│   ├── string.ts      # only used by error message builder
│   └── number.ts      # only used by metrics collector
```

Three files, three single callers, one shared parent. The parent
exists because the author thought "these might be useful elsewhere".
They were not useful elsewhere; they never will be. The author
anticipated reuse that did not come. The right shape would have been
to keep each helper inside its sole caller's concern folder.

```ts
// report/formatter.ts — the helper that should never have moved
import { formatIsoDate } from '../utils/date.js';

export function formatReport(event: ReportEvent): string {
  // ...uses formatIsoDate exactly once...
}
```

The `formatIsoDate` import tells the reader the formatter depends on
a shared utility. But there is no second caller. The "shared"
utility is a single-caller helper dressed up as cross-cutting. The
right shape:

```ts
// report/formatter.ts — the helper lives with its caller
export function formatReport(event: ReportEvent): string {
  const formattedDate = formatIsoDate(event.occurredAt);
  // ...
}

function formatIsoDate(input: Date): string {
  return input.toISOString().slice(0, 10);
}
```

The reader sees the helper and its caller in the same file. When a
second concern genuinely needs the same formatter, the move to a
shared location is justified by the second use site.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a new file under a
  `utils/` or `common/` directory without a justifying comment
  and a second use site blocks the PR.
- **File naming**. Files named `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `misc.ts`,
  `common.ts`, `stuff.ts` are blocked at review. The author is
  asked to name the file after what it does.
- **Quarterly audit**. A standing review of "what lives in the
  common directories" is part of release prep. Files that lost
  their second use site are moved back to their last surviving
  caller's folder.

## Exceptions

A genuine cross-cutting helper — for example, an `assertNever` exhaustiveness
guard, or a date format shared by logs, reports, and tests — lives in
a top-level module. The module's name must describe what it does
(`assert-never.ts`, `iso-date.ts`), not what it is (`utils.ts`). The
author must demonstrate the multiple use sites in the PR.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own working
experience. The discipline of "decide before you create" is
explicitly drawn from Rule of Three — a heuristic named
informally in software folklore that an abstraction is
worth its cost when three concrete cases exist. The rule names
the heuristic without citing a single reference because the
heuristic is older than the JavaScript ecosystem and predates
the project's chosen stack.
