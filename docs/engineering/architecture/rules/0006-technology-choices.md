# 0006 — Technology Choices: Assumptions Made Explicit

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review and release process).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Every technology choice that shapes the codebase — language mode,
module system, validation strategy, dependency philosophy, runtime
target — must be a **deliberate assumption**, not an inheritance from
defaults.

A deliberate assumption is:

1. Stated in writing, in a place a contributor will find it (an ADR
   in `decisions/`, a rule in `rules/`, or a comment at the boundary
   where the assumption bites).
2. Justified in terms of what it rules out, not just what it enables.
   "We use TypeScript strict mode" is not enough; "We use TypeScript
   strict mode so that the compiler is the first reviewer of every
   PR" is.
3. Revisited when the assumption starts costing more than it saves.
   The cost shows up as test-suite patches that exist only to satisfy
   the type system, or as dependency conflicts at every release.

The defaults of the language, the framework, or the package manager
are not assumptions. They are accidents of choice. Treating them as
assumptions is how a codebase drifts from "we chose this" to "it just
happened to be like that".

## Why

A foundation library reaches users who do not share its assumptions.
The choice of ESM-only, the choice of a specific validator, the
choice of a Node.js version, the choice of CommonJS-or-not, all of
these become contracts that downstream code must respect. A choice
that was not deliberate becomes a constraint that no one can
explain.

The same logic applies inside the codebase: a function that silently
relies on a Promise being resolved synchronously, a module that
assumes Node.js 22 features, a config that depends on a specific
build tool's behaviour. Each of these is an assumption made by an
author who did not have to think about the alternative. When the
alternative becomes relevant — when a Node version is dropped, when
a build tool is replaced, when a user reports a bug — the assumption
becomes a wall.

## The shape of a deliberate technology assumption

Every assumption in this codebase should answer four questions in a
single paragraph:

- **What is the choice?** "ESM-only TypeScript, published as `.js`
  with `.d.ts` declarations. No CommonJS shim."
- **What does it enable?** "Consumers import from `@scope/pkg` and
  get tree-shaking, top-level await, and exact types from the
  package source."
- **What does it rule out?** "Consumers on CommonJS resolvers
  cannot use this package without dynamic `import()` or a build
  step. We accept that exclusion because the alternative (a CJS
  shim) would double the surface area to maintain."
- **When would we revisit?** "When Node.js ends ESM-only support
  (it has not announced this), or when a downstream pattern
  suggests the exclusion is becoming a tax rather than a choice."

A choice without a "what does it rule out" is the smell. Every
choice rules something out; an author who cannot name what is
ruled out has not understood the choice.

## Specific choices this codebase commits to

These are the assumptions made explicit. New assumptions join this
list, they do not replace it.

- **TypeScript strict mode.** The compiler is the first reviewer.
  No `any` leak, no implicit `any`, no unchecked index access.
- **ESM-only.** No CommonJS shim, no `module: "commonjs"`, no
  dynamic require from the published surface. A consumer on CJS
  uses dynamic `import()`.
- **Standard Schema for runtime validation.** The validation
  contract is the schema, not the validator. Zod, Valibot, and
  ArkType all implement Standard Schema; the consumer chooses.
  Pinning to a specific validator would couple every consumer to
  a release cadence that is not ours.
- **Dependency minimalism.** The runtime surface is the library
  plus its declared peer dependencies. A new runtime dependency
  must justify itself (rule 0001, invariant 8); a new dev
  dependency must justify itself by what it enables in CI or in the
  inner loop.
- **Function-based API surface.** No classes on the consumer side.
  Factories, predicates, and combinators are the public shape. The
  reason: classes introduce an inheritance coupling that the
  consumer did not ask for. Functions compose without inheritance.
- **Honest runtime.** No transpilation tricks that hide the runtime
  target. The code is written for the runtime it ships to.

## How to add a new assumption

When a PR introduces a new technology choice — a new dependency, a
new build step, a new runtime feature, a new compiler flag — the PR
description must:

1. Name the choice.
2. State what it enables.
3. State what it rules out.
4. State under what circumstances the choice would be revisited.

If any of the four is missing, the PR is incomplete and the
reviewer should ask for it.

When the choice is durable — it will shape the codebase for a year
or more — the same four answers live in an ADR under
`architecture/decisions/`. When the choice is local to a module, the
four answers live in a comment at the boundary where the choice
bites.

## What this looks like in violation

A PR that adds `pnpm add lodash` with the commit message "needed for
deep clone". What is missing:

- What does lodash enable that the standard library does not?
- What does lodash rule out (license risk, release cadence,
  surface area, etc.)?
- Under what circumstances would we revisit?

The PR adds an assumption without naming it. The next contributor who
looks for "why lodash?" finds nothing and either keeps it (because
removing it feels risky) or duplicates it (because they do not know
whether to add or remove).

A second smell: a `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": false` because the
project started before strict mode was the default. The assumption
"TypeScript with relaxed checks" was inherited from a default, not
chosen. It becomes a wall every time a contributor wants to enable a
strict-mode feature.

**Bad** — a choice without a justification:

```ts
// In a PR description
'Added zod to validate the user signup payload.';
```

The reviewer reads this and has no way to evaluate the choice. Is
the standard library not enough? Is Standard Schema acceptable? Why
zod and not Valibot or ArkType? The reviewer is forced to either
trust the author or block the PR to ask.

**Good** — the four questions answered in the PR description:

```md
## Why zod

- **What is the choice?** zod as the runtime validator for user
  signup payloads, used via the Standard Schema adapter (not the
  zod-native API).
- **What does it enable?** Inference of `UserSignup` types directly
  from the schema, ergonomic error messages, and Standard Schema
  compliance that lets consumers swap validators later.
- **What does it rule out?** A direct dependency on zod's API. We
  use Standard Schema as the contract; if a future user prefers
  Valibot, the change is local to the validator factory.
- **When would we revisit?** If the package's release cadence slows
  below our SLA, or if a security advisory lands and is not
  resolved within 30 days.
```

The reviewer can now evaluate the choice against alternatives. The
next contributor who looks for "why zod?" finds the answer in the
git log.

## Enforcement

- **PR review**. A reviewer who sees a new dependency, a new build
  step, a new compiler flag, or a new runtime feature without a
  four-answer justification in the PR description blocks the PR.
- **Release audit**. A standing review at release time lists every
  dependency and every technology assumption. Anything that has lost
  its justification (the dependency is no longer used, the choice
  no longer applies) is removed in the same release.
- **Quarterly review**. The list of "specific choices this codebase
  commits to" above is reviewed. Stale choices are either reaffirmed
  with a current justification or marked for removal.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own architectural
commitments. No single external reference anchors it. The
four-question template (what, enables, rules out, revisits) is
modelled on the _Architecture Decision Record_ convention
popularised by Michael Nygard's _Documenting Architecture
Decisions_; the project tracks individual ADRs in
`docs/engineering/architecture/decisions/` and the rule governs
the **shape** those ADRs and inline commitments must take.

## Exceptions

A transitive dependency installed by a direct dependency is not a
choice and is not subject to this rule. The choice was the direct
dependency; the transitive follows. If a transitive dependency's
behaviour becomes load-bearing, that is a smell to investigate
under rule 0001 invariant 8 ("no dependency without
justification"), not a rule on its own.
