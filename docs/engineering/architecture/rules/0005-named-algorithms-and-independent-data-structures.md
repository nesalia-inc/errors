# 0005 — Named Algorithms and Independent Data Structures

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Three invariants, all anchored in the same principle: a reader should
be able to understand **what** the code does without first having to
decipher **how** it is described.

1. **Algorithms are named.** A depth-first search described in three
   lines of inline code with a `// DFS walk` comment is not a named
   algorithm. It is a comment that happens to be near code. A named
   algorithm is a function, a type, or a class whose name is the
   concept, and whose body is the implementation. The reader should
   be able to read the name and trust it.

2. **No project-internal diminutives.** Names carry the meaning that
   comments cannot. A **project-internal diminutive** — one that
   is not a word in the language, the ecosystem, or the
   mathematical convention — trains the reader to translate every
   line. `DFS`, `mgr`, `ctx`, `arr`, `fn`, `cb`, `usr`, `cfg`,
   `evt` are diminutives; spell them out as
   `depthFirstSearch`, `manager`, `context`, `items`, `function`,
   `callback`, `user`, `configuration`, `event`. The cost of the
   extra characters is paid once; the cost of the abbreviation is
   paid every time the code is read.

3. **Data structures are explicit and independent.** A stack, queue,
   heap, ring buffer, or sorted map used by an algorithm is a
   **thing**. It deserves a type, a file, and a name. It must not
   be inlined as a primitive array with `push`/`pop` because that
   was the first thing that worked. More importantly, the data
   structure must be **independent of the algorithm that first used
   it**: an `ErrorInheritanceStack` for the inheritance walk must
   not encode "depth-first" in its type. If a second algorithm needs
   a stack for breadth-first traversal, it must be able to use the
   same type.

### Diminutives: the three categories

Not every short name is a diminutive. The rule distinguishes three
categories by their source, not by their length.

- **Language-standard words**: `id`, `url`, `json`, `html`, `css`,
  `api`, `http`, `cli`, `sdk`, `uri`. These are words in the
  vocabulary of the language and the ecosystem. The reader does not
  translate them; they are part of the working vocabulary. The
  rule does **not** ban them.
- **Mathematical and conventional names**: `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `T`,
  `U`, `V` for loop indices and generic type parameters. These
  names have a tradition older than any project and a density of
  meaning that is hard to replicate with longer names in the same
  context. The rule does **not** ban them; the rule requires
  them to stay within the contexts where the convention applies
  (loop bodies, generic signatures, mathematical operations).
- **Project-internal diminutives**: `mgr`, `ctx`, `arr`, `fn`,
  `cb`, `dfs`, `bfs`, `usr`, `cfg`, `evt`, `req`, `res`. These are
  neither language-standard nor mathematical. They are local
  shortcuts that the author chose for the line they were writing.
  The reader has no way to know them without reading the project's
  glossary. The rule **bans** them.

The length of a name is irrelevant to the rule. `id` is one
character and a word; `usr` is three characters and a diminutive.
`T` is one character and a convention; `dfs` is three characters
and a diminutive. The source of the name is what matters, not
the length.

### Scope and reuse

The rule applies uniformly to public and private names. A private
helper that uses `dfs` as a parameter name still trains the next
contributor who reads the helper to translate `dfs` to "depth-first
search". The training tax is paid by every reader, including the
author on the day they forget the context.

Loop indices (`i`, `j`, `k`) are the **single exception** because
they are a mathematical convention, not a project choice. The
exception is scoped to tight, single-screen loops where the
convention is universal. An `i` in a fifty-line function is not
the same as an `i` in a five-line loop; the second is convention,
the first is a diminished name that should be spelled out.

## Why

A comment that names an algorithm is a **deferred definition**. The
comment promises a structure that does not exist; the code that
follows is responsible for delivering on the promise. If the code
delivers, the comment becomes redundant; if it does not, the comment
becomes a lie. A function whose name is the algorithm is honest by
construction: the name is the contract, the body is the proof.

Diminutives are a tax that compounds. A codebase that uses `ctx`
everywhere trains its readers to translate every line. A codebase that
spells `context` trains them to read. The first codebase looks
"professional"; the second is professional.

Coupling a data structure to the algorithm that first used it is a
form of premature commitment. The next algorithm that needs the
same structure either duplicates it or forks it; either way the
codebase loses. Independence is what makes a `Stack<T>` reusable
across BFS, DFS, and undo-log implementations.

## What this looks like in violation

Three shapes that this rule exists to catch:

- **Inline algorithm with comment**:

  ```ts
  // DFS walk of inheritance tree using stack (prevents GC pressure)
  const stack: ErrorFactory[] = [factory as ErrorFactory];
  const seen = new Set<ErrorFactory>();
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const current = stack.pop()!;
    if (seen.has(current)) continue;
    seen.add(current);
    if (current === ErrorType) return true;
    const inherits = (current as ErrorFactory).inherits;
    if (inherits !== undefined) {
      if (Array.isArray(inherits)) {
        for (let i = 0; i < inherits.length; i++) {
          stack.push(inherits[i]);
        }
      } else {
        stack.push(inherits);
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  What is wrong: the comment names the algorithm, but the algorithm
  is not a function. The reader has to read twenty lines to confirm
  that the comment is accurate. The stack is a primitive `Array`
  whose only contract is `push` and `pop`; a second algorithm cannot
  reuse it without duplicating the type. The names `stack`, `seen`,
  `current`, `inherits` are local; a reader scanning the function
  does not know which is which.

  What the right shape looks like:

  ```ts
  const result = walkInheritance(
    factory,
    inheritanceDepthFirst(),
    (current) => current === ErrorType
  );
  return result.found;
  ```

  Where `walkInheritance` is a generic traversal function in a
  shared module, `inheritanceDepthFirst` is a stack-based strategy
  in its own file, and the predicate is named for what it tests.

- **Diminutive-heavy naming**:

  ```ts
  function mgrErr(err: ErrT, ctx: Ctx): void {
    const m = err.msg;
    const arr = ctx.items.map((it) => it.id);
    cb(arr);
  }
  ```

  What is wrong: a reader has to translate `mgr`, `ErrT`, `Ctx`,
  `m`, `arr`, `cb`, `it` before they can think about the function.
  The function body is shorter to type than to read.

  What the right shape looks like:

  ```ts
  function reportError(error: DomainError, requestContext: RequestContext): void {
    const message = error.message;
    const identifiers = requestContext.items.map((item) => item.identifier);
    notifyListeners(identifiers);
  }
  ```

- **Algorithm-specific data structure**:

  ```ts
  // In the inheritance walker
  interface InheritanceWalkerState {
    stack: ErrorFactory[]; // Implicit: depth-first
    seen: Set<ErrorFactory>;
    found: boolean;
  }
  ```

  What is wrong: the type encodes the algorithm in its shape. A
  breadth-first walker cannot reuse `InheritanceWalkerState` without
  duplicating the interface. The right shape is to separate the
  walker from the strategy:

  ```ts
  // Stack.ts (independent)
  interface Stack<T> {
    push(item: T): void;
    pop(): T | undefined;
    isEmpty(): boolean;
  }

  // depth-first.ts (strategy)
  function depthFirst<T>(
    start: T,
    expand: (node: T) => Iterable<T>,
    visit: (node: T) => boolean | void
  ): boolean {
    /* ... */
  }

  // Inheritance traversal (consumer)
  function isInheritedFrom(factory: ErrorFactory, target: ErrorFactory): boolean {
    return depthFirst(
      factory,
      (f) => f.inherits ?? [],
      (f) => f === target
    );
  }
  ```

## When this rule does not apply

A single-caller helper whose concept is local to its file lives
inline. See rule 0003. The point of this rule is to capture **shared
concepts** (an algorithm, a data structure, a name) and to surface
them at the right grain. A five-line local computation that does not
deserve a name does not need one.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees an inline algorithm with a
  comment-naming-it blocks the PR and asks for the algorithm to be
  extracted to a function or type.
- **Naming audit**. A standing review of function and variable names
  during PR review catches abbreviations before they land. "If I
  had to look up what this abbreviation means, it is wrong."
- **Structure audit**. A quarterly review of "where does this data
  structure live, and which algorithms use it?" surfaces the
  structure-vs-algorithm coupling when it is still small.

## Exceptions

- **Language-standard words**: `id`, `url`, `json`, `html`, `css`,
  `api`, `http`, `cli`, `sdk`, `uri`, `xml`. These are words in
  the working vocabulary, not diminutives. The rule does not ban
  them.
- **Mathematical and conventional names**: `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `T`,
  `U`, `V`. These are conventions older than any project. The
  rule applies them only within the contexts where the convention
  holds (loop bodies, generic signatures, mathematical operations).
  An `i` in a five-line loop is fine; an `i` in a fifty-line
  function is not.
- **Generated code, vendor code, and bindings to external systems**
  where the shape is fixed by the other side and the rule cannot
  apply.

## What senior practitioners say

### On diminutives

Three sources span the spectrum, and the rule operationalises the
intersection.

> "Wrong. You might think you are faster at typing, but you don't
> write code in one go and never ever get back to it again. [...]
> Spending the extra minute it takes to write words in full will
> benefit you and your readers. [...] Can you tell what any of
> these names refer to, univocally?"
>
> — Julio Merino, _Readability: No abbreviations_, June 2013.

Merino's position is the strictest. The rule bans project-internal
diminutives for the same reason he gives: the reader cannot
decipher them without a glossary, and the glossary does not exist.

> "Names must be descriptive and clear to a new reader. Do not use
> abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers
> outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters
> within a word."
>
> — Google TypeScript Style Guide, § Naming.

Google's position is the calibrated one. The rule follows Google's
framing: abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar are banned;
abbreviations that are standard are kept. The three-category
distinction in this rule is Google's distinction made explicit.

> "Standard Abbreviations are Fine [...] `iostream`, `int`,
> `std`, `cout`, `cin`, `endl` are all abbreviations. You
> wouldn't expect these to 'count' as abbreviations per se,
> because they are part of the language."
>
> "A name's length should not exceed its information content.
> For a local variable, the name `i` conveys as much information
> as `index` or `idx` and is quicker to read."
>
> — Keegan Donley, _When Can I Use Abbreviated Variable Names?_,
> August 2023; Russ Cox, _research!rsc: Names_, February 2010.

Donley and Cox are the conventional exceptions. `i` in a loop,
`T` in a generic, `url` in a request handler — these names have
a meaning density that long names cannot replicate in the same
context. The rule's category "mathematical and conventional names"
is the union of Donley's language-standard and Cox's
information-content positions.

### On independent data structures

The "data structures are explicit and independent" invariant has
a thirty-year lineage in software engineering, anchored in
generic programming.

> "By expressing the algorithms in terms of these basic access
> operations and making the operations parameters, we permit a
> single expression of the algorithms to be used with any concrete
> representation of the container."
>
> — Alexander Stepanov and David Musser, _Algorithm-oriented
> Generic Libraries_, Software — Practice and Experience,
> vol. 24(7), July 1994.

Stepanov and Musser formalised what the rule calls
"independence": an algorithm parameterised by access operations
(`push`, `pop`, `less`, `swap`) works against any container that
exposes those operations. The container does not encode the
algorithm; the algorithm does not encode the container. The
`Stack<T>` of the rule is the `Sequence<T>` of Stepanov; the
depth-first walker is the `for_each` of Stepanov. Same
principle, three decades apart.

> "A `for` loop is just a `find_if` over a range with a body
> side effect. A `find` is a `count_if` over a range with early
> termination."
>
> — Alexander Stepanov, _Notes on Programming_ (talk transcript,
> A9.com, 2007).

Stepanov's deeper point: the algorithms are also independent
of each other. A walker can be expressed in terms of a fold; a
fold can be expressed in terms of a traversal. The rule's
"algorithms are named" invariant is the project-level restatement
of this. Each algorithm is a thing the consumer can name and
combine, not an inline shape the consumer has to read.

  the named algorithms this rule produces at the top of their
  callers. This rule extracts; 0007 composes.

- **Rule 0003** — File Placement: a single-caller algorithm does
  not need to be extracted yet; this rule says "name it when it has
  a second caller", not "extract every algorithm immediately".
