# 0010 — Typed Environment Access

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

No business-logic file reads `process.env`, `globalThis`, or any
other runtime global directly. Every environment value is read
through a **typed accessor module** that:

1. Declares the expected keys as a literal-union type or a schema.
2. Reads the values exactly once at module load (or behind an
   explicit, memoised function).
3. Returns typed values, not strings, to the rest of the codebase.

The accessor module is the only place in the codebase that touches
runtime globals. Every other file imports the typed accessor.

## Why

`process.env.X` is a `string | undefined` with no documentation, no
type, and no validation. Every read repeats the same type assertion
that hides the value's real shape. Two modules reading the same key
may disagree about what it means. A typo in the key name compiles.

The typed accessor solves all four problems in one move. The keys
are declared once; the values are parsed once; the rest of the
codebase gets a function call that returns the right type. The
accessor becomes the place where the runtime meets the type system,
and there is exactly one such place.

This is also the rule that lets the codebase avoid the runtime
dependency on `@types/node` (rule 0006). The accessor declares its
own ambient `process` shape; every other file does not have to.

## What this looks like in practice

A `process.env` read scattered across the codebase:

```ts
// In one module
const legacyGate = process?.env?.DEESSEJS_ERRORS_LEGACY_TEMPLATES;
if (legacyGate === '1') return;

// In another module
const logLevel = process?.env?.LOG_LEVEL ?? 'info';

// In a third module
const apiKey = process?.env?.API_KEY;
```

Each read redeclares `process` because `@types/node` is not in scope.
Each read uses `?.` and `??` to defend against the absence of
`process`. None of the keys are documented. None of the values are
validated.

The same logic centralised:

```ts
// env.ts — the only file that touches process.env
type Environment = {
  DEESSEJS_ERRORS_LEGACY_TEMPLATES?: '1' | undefined;
  LOG_LEVEL?: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error';
  API_KEY?: string;
};

declare const process: { env: Environment } | undefined;

function readEnvironment(): Environment {
  return (process as { env: Environment } | undefined)?.env ?? {};
}

const environment: Environment = readEnvironment();

// env.ts is also the only file allowed to declare `process`.
```

Every other file imports the typed accessor:

```ts
import { environment } from './env.js';

if (environment.DEESSEJS_ERRORS_LEGACY_TEMPLATES === '1') return;
const logLevel = environment.LOG_LEVEL ?? 'info';
```

No cast in any consumer. No duplicated `?.` chains. The keys are
documented in one place. The values are validated in one place.

## When the rule does not apply

A test fixture, a debug script, or a build-time tool that runs once
is allowed to read `process.env` directly. The rule applies to
**code that ships in the runtime**: the library, the apps, the
shared modules. The boundary between "tooling" and "runtime" is
sharp; do not blur it.

A Node-API integration that genuinely needs runtime global
(`globalThis.crypto.subtle`, `process.versions.node` for capability
detection) is allowed, but the read happens inside a small typed
module and the rest of the codebase imports the typed accessor.

## Why the values stay primitives (rule 0015 carve-out)

The `Environment` type in the example above declares
`API_KEY?: string` — a primitive. Rule 0015 says a value that
represents a domain concept should be typed as a domain-specific
type, not a primitive. The carve-out is intentional: environment
values are **runtime configuration**, not domain concepts. A
`Message` is a `Message` because the application reasons about
messages; an `API_KEY` is an opaque string the application passes
to a third party. Wrapping `API_KEY` in a branded type would
add ceremony without information — there is no second
`API_KEY`-shaped value in the codebase that the brand would
prevent the consumer from confusing it with.

The carve-out has a sharp boundary: the moment a value crosses
the typed accessor and enters the domain, it must be converted
to the domain type (rule 0015). The accessor is the only place
where the primitive is allowed to live.

## How to refactor a scattered read

When you find `process.env` references in business code:

1. List every key that appears.
2. Create `env.ts` (or `config.ts`) at the appropriate boundary
   (the library, the app, the workspace).
3. Declare the environment as a literal-union type, with each key
   optional and each value typed.
4. Move the reads into `env.ts`. Each read happens once.
5. Export a typed `environment` object or a typed `getEnv()`
   function.
6. Replace every `process.env` reference in business code with the
   import.

The refactor is mechanical and reviewable in one PR.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees `process.env` in a business
  file (anything under `src/` that ships at runtime) blocks the PR.
- **Grep gate**. A standing check before release: `grep -r
"process\.env" src/` returns only the accessor module. If any
  other file shows up, the release is blocked until the references
  are migrated.
- **CI lint** (future). A custom rule or `no-restricted-syntax`
  can flag `process.env` access outside the accessor module. The
  rule's existence is the enforcement signal even before it is
  automated.

## Exceptions

A file that **defines** the accessor (the file the rule says is the
only place `process.env` is read) is allowed to access it. That
file is the rule, not the exception.

- **Rule 0006** — Technology Choices: the rule that motivates
  avoiding `@types/node` as a runtime dependency. This rule is the
  operational form of "minimal dependencies, typed boundaries".
- **Rule 0008** — No Chained Type Assertions: the type discipline
  this rule relies on. A typed accessor that required an `as
unknown as Environment` to construct is a violation of 0008; the
  accessor module is the only file that legitimately narrows the
  ambient `process` shape.
- **Rule 0015** — Domain-Specific Types Over Primitives: rule
  0015 requires domain concepts to be domain types. Environment
  values are configuration, not domain concepts — they remain
  primitives inside the accessor (see "Why the values stay
  primitives" above). The moment a value crosses the accessor
  and enters the domain, rule 0015 applies in full.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own architectural
commitments. The pattern of a single typed accessor module is
common in Node.js backends (NestJS ConfigService, Vite's
`loadEnv`, Next.js env validation via `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`); the
project does not adopt any of these libraries directly because
the rule's discipline is one line of code, not a dependency.
The rule is the lightweight version of a pattern those libraries
formalise; the formalisation is left to the rule itself.
