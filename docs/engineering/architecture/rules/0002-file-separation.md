# 0002 — File Separation: by Concern, not by Syntax Kind

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Within a single concern (a feature, a module, a domain), code is
separated by **what it does**, not by **what kind of symbol it is**.

- **Types** for one concern live in `types.ts` of that concern.
- **Constants** for one concern live in `constants.ts` of that
  concern.
- **Functions** for one concern live in `index.ts`, `factory.ts`,
  `parser.ts`, `formatter.ts`, or whatever verb-named file describes
  the operation — not in a generic `utils.ts` or `helpers.ts` that
  mixes every helper from every concern.

Across concerns, types and helpers **must not leak** into a shared
global. There is no `src/types.ts`, no `src/constants.ts` that holds
"the types of the project", no `src/utils/index.ts` that re-exports
every helper in the repo. A file that wants a type or constant from
another concern imports it from that concern's `types.ts` or
`constants.ts` directly.

## Why

A type, a constant, and a function are not interchangeable artefacts.
They live different lifecycles: a constant changes rarely and reads
like a table of contents; a type is a contract that constrains every
caller; a function is an operation with inputs, outputs, and side
effects. Mixing them in a single file buries the contract in the
implementation, and forces a reader to skim past implementations to
find the shape of a value.

The opposite failure is just as bad. A single `types.ts` at the
package root that holds every type in the codebase invites circular
imports, forces a deep dependency graph, and makes it impossible to
extract a sub-concern without surgery. The grain of separation must
match the grain of the domain, not the grain of the language.

The right cut is per **concern**: a `ValidationError` carries its
own types, its own constants (validation codes, severity levels),
and its own functions. A `User` carries its own types and constants.
They share nothing at the package root, but within each concern the
kinds are separated.

## What this looks like in practice

A concern folder that follows the rule looks like:

```
validation/
├── types.ts       # interfaces, discriminated unions, type aliases
├── constants.ts   # codes, defaults, lookup tables
├── validator.ts   # the operation(s)
└── index.ts       # public re-exports, if needed
```

A concern folder that **violates** the rule looks like one of these:

- **Single mega file**: `validation/index.ts` contains the type, the
  constants, and every function. Hard to skim, hard to refactor.

  ```ts
  // validation/index.ts — every concern in one file
  export interface ValidationRule {
    /* ... */
  }
  export const DEFAULT_RULES: ValidationRule[] = [/* ... */];
  export function validate(input: unknown): Result {
    /* 200 lines */
  }
  export function formatErrors(errors: Error[]): string {
    /* ... */
  }
  ```

- **Syntax-based split**: `types/types.ts` holding every type from
  every concern, `constants/constants.ts` holding every constant.
  Encourages cross-cutting imports, defeats tree-shaking, signals
  "we don't know our own domain boundaries".

  ```ts
  // types/types.ts — every type in the project
  export interface ValidationRule {
    /* ... */
  }
  export interface UserProfile {
    /* unrelated concern */
  }
  export interface InvoiceLine {
    /* unrelated concern */
  }
  ```

## What about generic helpers?

A helper that is genuinely cross-cutting (date formatting, string
trimming, an `assertNever` guard) belongs in a small, focused module
whose name describes **what the helper does**, not "utils". Two
helpers in the same file is fine if they serve the same purpose. A
catch-all `utils.ts` that grows over time is the symptom this rule
exists to prevent.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a `types.ts` at the package
  root that contains types from multiple concerns blocks the PR.
- **Import-graph check**: a CI step (or a manual audit during
  release prep) verifies that no module imports across concerns
  through a shared barrel that re-exports types from more than one
  concern.
- **Refactor signal**: when a `types.ts` or `constants.ts` starts
  mixing concerns, splitting it is treated as a same-week cleanup,
  not a backlog item.

## Exceptions

None at the package root level. Within a single concern, a tiny
helper that lives next to its single caller may stay in the same
file (e.g. an internal helper inside `validator.ts`); this is not a
violation because the file is named for its operation, not for
"helpers".

- **Rule 0003** — File Placement: the decision rule that picks the
  home for a file once the concern is identified. This rule says
  "no cross-concern `types.ts`"; 0003 says "where does this new file
  go before I write it" and consolidates the codebase's three
  extraction thresholds (one-caller inline, two-concern move,
  three-case abstraction).
- **Rule 0011** — Filenames Are kebab-case: the casing discipline
  that makes a folder of separated files read as one project.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own working
experience. No external reference anchors it. The shape (one
file per syntactic kind, per concern) is a JavaScript
convention; the project's experience is that the convention
breaks down when cross-concern types accumulate in a shared
`types.ts`. The rule captures the failure mode before it
becomes a smell.
