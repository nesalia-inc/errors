# 0012 — Prefer `type` Over `interface`

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Every shape in this codebase is declared with `type`, not
`interface`, unless one of three conditions is met:

1. **Declaration merging is required.** A consumer extends the
   shape by adding fields to a second `interface X { ... }`
   declaration in a different file. Only `interface` supports
   this; `type` does not.
2. **A class implements the shape and the shape has no runtime
   behaviour.** `class Foo implements Shape { ... }` works with
   both, but a class that needs the shape to be **open** for
   third-party additions (a library extension point) is the
   natural fit for `interface`.
3. **The shape is part of a host type the project does not own.**
   Augmenting a third-party `interface` (e.g. extending a host
   framework's request type) uses `interface` because the host
   already chose `interface`.

In every other case — a shape that describes a value, a union, an
intersection, a function signature, a conditional, a mapped type — the
declaration is `type`. The shape of the code becomes uniform; the
choice between `type` and `interface` stops being made on every
declaration.

## Why

`type` and `interface` overlap in the cases most codebases use them.
For a plain object shape, both compile to the same structural type;
both have the same IDE support; both produce the same error
messages on misuse. The choice between them is not a type-system
choice; it is a **convention** choice.

The convention this rule picks is `type`, for three reasons:

- **`type` is more expressive.** `type` accepts unions,
  intersections, conditionals, mapped types, and template literal
  types. `interface` accepts unions only with `&` and only for
  object shapes. A codebase that uses `type` uniformly never has
  to reach for `interface` when the shape needs an expression
  `type` cannot write.
- **`type` is one declaration site.** An `interface X` declared in
  two files is a single shape that the compiler merges. A `type X`
  declared twice is an error. The merge is occasionally useful
  (declaration merging for host augmentation) and frequently a
  source of "where did this field come from?" bugs. Defaulting to
  `type` makes merge a deliberate choice, not an accident.
- **`type` is the union's natural home.** A codebase that mixes
  unions and interfaces has to remember that `interface X extends
Y | Z` is invalid; the syntax switches between the two. A
  codebase that uses `type` uniformly has one syntax for "shape"
  and one syntax for "either this or that".

The rule is not "no `interface` ever". The rule is "the choice
between the two is not yours to make on every declaration. The
default is `type`. The exception list is short, named, and audited."

## What this looks like in practice

A declaration that should be `type`:

```ts
// Good — the shape is a value description, not an extension point
type ValidationRule = {
  readonly field: string;
  readonly severity: 'error' | 'warning';
  readonly code: string;
};
```

A declaration that must be `interface` because declaration merging
is the point:

```ts
// Required: third-party host augmentation
declare module 'express' {
  interface Request {
    requestId: string;
  }
}
```

A declaration that must be `interface` because a library exposes
an extension point:

```ts
// The library author chose interface deliberately — they expect
// consumers to add fields by declaring the interface again in
// their own module.
interface PluginContext {
  config: Record<string, unknown>;
  logger: Logger;
}
```

The library author writes `interface` because the consumer might
add fields via declaration merging. The consumer writes `type` for
their own shapes, because they control their own shapes.

## When the rule does not apply

The rule applies to **shape declarations**. It does not apply to:

- **Class declarations** themselves. `class Foo { ... }` is not
  affected by the rule; the rule is about declaring the shapes
  classes implement or the unions and intersections they
  participate in.
- **Type assertions** of host types. The shape of the ambient
  declaration is fixed by the host.
- **Build-time tooling** that requires one or the other for
  configuration (rare, but some tool configs use `interface X` as a
  literal label).
- **Augmentation files** (the `*.d.ts` files that extend host
  types). Augmentation is `interface`; this is the canonical
  exception.

## How to convert an `interface` to a `type`

When a contributor has written `interface` and the rule says `type`,
the conversion is mechanical:

```ts
// Before
interface ValidationRule {
  readonly field: string;
  readonly severity: 'error' | 'warning';
}

// After
type ValidationRule = {
  readonly field: string;
  readonly severity: 'error' | 'warning';
};
```

The conversion is lossless for object shapes that do not use
declaration merging. The compiler emits the same structural type;
the IDE shows the same hints; the consumers see no change.

A conversion that requires more than a keyword swap is a signal that
the original `interface` was doing something `type` cannot do. The
signal is not a failure to convert; it is the rule's way of telling
the contributor "this `interface` is on the exception list; document
why".

## What this looks like in violation

Three shapes that this rule exists to catch.

The first, mixed convention:

```ts
// File 1
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
}

// File 2
type Admin = {
  id: string;
  permissions: string[];
};

// File 3
interface Config {
  env: 'production' | 'staging';
}

// File 4
type FeatureFlag = {
  name: string;
  enabled: boolean;
};
```

The same project, four files, four declarations, two conventions.
The reader has to remember which keyword was used in which file
when they want to add a field.

The second, `interface` used where the shape is closed:

```ts
// Bad — the shape is closed; no third party extends it
// The author chose interface because that was the example they
// followed, not because they wanted declaration merging.
interface UserSettings {
  theme: 'light' | 'dark';
  language: string;
}
```

A `type` is the right shape. A future contributor who wants to
add a field finds `type UserSettings = { ... }` and edits the
shape in one place.

The third, `type` used where `interface` is required:

```ts
// Bad — third-party host augmentation with type
// (TypeScript will accept this in some configurations but
// declaration merging does not work as expected.)
declare module 'express' {
  type Request = {
    requestId: string;
  };
}
```

The augmentation does not merge into the host `Request`. The
consumer's `requestId` field is invisible to library code that
expects an augmented `Request`. The fix is `interface`.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees `interface X` in a file that
  does not perform declaration merging, class implementation of an
  open shape, or third-party augmentation asks for the `type`
  conversion.
- **Lint rule** (future). A custom ESLint rule can flag `interface`
  declarations outside the canonical exception list. The rule's
  existence is the enforcement signal even before it is automated.
- **Quarterly audit**. A standing review of "where do we still use
  `interface`?" surfaces the candidates that slipped through. Each
  is either converted or annotated as a documented exception.

## Exceptions

The rule is absolute except for the three conditions listed at the
top: declaration merging, class implementation of open shapes, and
host type augmentation. Each `interface` declaration in the codebase
should be traceable to one of those three conditions. A
declaration that cannot be traced is a violation.

  natural home for the `type` declarations this rule produces.
- **Rule 0008** — No Chained Type Assertions: the type discipline
  this rule relies on. A `type` declaration that requires a cast
  to use is a violation of 0008; the declaration is the wrong
  shape.
- **Rule 0014** — Functions Over Classes for Public API: the
  exception 2 above ("a class implements the shape and the shape
  has no runtime behaviour") describes a class that _implements_
  an `interface`; that class must remain non-exported per rule 0014. The public shape is the interface; the class is the
  internal implementer. The two rules cooperate: 0012 picks
  `interface` for the extension point, 0014 hides the class that
  implements it.

## Sources

This rule is a synthesis of the project's own working
experience. The TypeScript documentation itself states that
`type` and `interface` are largely interchangeable in the cases
most codebases use them; the rule picks `type` as the default
because the expressiveness, single-declaration-site, and
union-friendly characteristics are not duplicated by
`interface`. The three documented exceptions (declaration
merging, class implementation of open shapes, host type
augmentation) are the cases where `interface` is genuinely
required.
