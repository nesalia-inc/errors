# 0015 — Domain-Specific Types Over Primitives

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

Every value that represents a **domain concept** is typed as a
**domain-specific type**, not as a primitive. A `Message` is a
`Message` with a `content` field, a `type` field, and whatever
fields the domain grows; it is **not** a bare `string`. A `UserId`
is a `UserId` with whatever fields a user-id carries; it is **not**
a bare `string`.

The rule applies to **all values that cross a module boundary**
or that participate in **more than one function**. A local variable
inside a one-line lambda may be a primitive; anything the consumer
will see, type, or extend is a domain-specific type.

A primitive is permitted at the **boundary** where a value first
enters the system (parsing JSON, reading an env var, accepting
foreign input). The conversion from primitive to domain type
happens at that boundary; the rest of the codebase sees the domain
type only.

## Why

A primitive is **typeless at the semantic level**. `string` is
every string at once; `number` is every number at once. The
compiler cannot tell a message from a username, a percentage from
a count, a user-id from a session-id. The reader who sees
`function send(message: string, user: string)` cannot know
whether the second argument is the username, the user-id, or the
session-id — the type is the same in all three cases. The reader
has to read the body to recover the meaning.

A domain-specific type **carries the meaning**. `function send(
message: Message, recipient: UserId)` says what each value is. The
reader does not have to guess. The compiler refuses to mix the
two: `send(message, recipient)` will not accept a username in the
second position.

The deeper problem is **extensibility**. A `Message` with `content`
and `type` is a **shape that can grow**. A new field (`priority`,
`correlationId`, `sentAt`) is a one-line type extension that
preserves every existing caller. A bare `string` cannot grow;
adding a field means breaking every function signature. The
domain-specific type is the **stable shape** that future
contributors extend without breaking consumers.

## What this looks like in practice

The bad shape, primitive as a domain concept:

```ts
// Bad — what is the difference between the two strings?
function sendNotification(message: string, recipient: string): void {
  // ...
}

sendNotification('Hello, world!', 'usr_123');
// Is the second argument a username, an id, a phone number?
// The compiler does not know. The reader has to read the body.
```

The right shape, domain-specific types:

```ts
// Good — each value is what it is. Literal unions are extracted as
// named domain types so the shape is reusable across the codebase
// and the literal strings appear in one place.
type MessageType = 'text' | 'image' | 'audio';
type MessagePriority = 'low' | 'normal' | 'high';

type Message = {
  readonly content: string;
  readonly type: MessageType;
  readonly priority?: MessagePriority;
  readonly correlationId?: string;
};

type UserId = {
  readonly value: string;
};

function sendNotification(message: Message, recipient: UserId): void {
  // ...
}

sendNotification({ content: 'Hello, world!', type: 'text' }, { value: 'usr_123' });
// The compiler checks the shape. The reader does not have to guess.
```

The literal unions are extracted as named types (`MessageType`,
`MessagePriority`) rather than inlined because:

- The same set of literals appears in multiple places (the type,
  the validation function, the rendering function). Extracting
  them once keeps the literal strings in **one place**; adding a
  new value is one line in the type and the compiler enforces
  that every consumer handles it.
- The name carries the meaning. A function parameter typed as
  `MessageType` is more readable than one typed as the literal
  union `'text' | 'image' | 'audio'`. The reader sees the
  concept; the literal is one step removed.
- The union is **reusable**. Other types that need the same set
  of literals (`NotificationFilter`, `MessageDraft`,
  `MessageSummary`) reuse `MessageType` instead of repeating the
  union.

The shape of `Message` is **open to extension** without breaking
existing callers. Adding `priority` is one line in the type
definition. Adding `sentAt` is one line. Each extension is
**additive** because the type is the contract.

The bad shape, primitive as an identifier:

```ts
// Bad — three strings, all the same type.
function transfer(fromAccountId: string, toAccountId: string, amount: number): void {
  // ...
}
```

When the right shape applies — multiple semantic IDs in the same
context:

```ts
// Good — each identifier is a distinct type. The compiler refuses
// to swap them.
type AccountId = string & { readonly __brand: 'AccountId' };
type CustomerId = string & { readonly __brand: 'CustomerId' };

function transfer(from: AccountId, to: AccountId, amount: number): void {
  // ...
}

// transfer(customerA, accountB, 100) — type error at the call site,
// before the function runs.
```

When the branded type does **not** apply — single identifier with
no internal structure:

```ts
// Bad — the brand adds no information. The id is just an
// incremental or UUID string. Branding forces every consumer to
// construct the branded type, which is friction without benefit.
type OrderId = string & { readonly __brand: 'OrderId' };

function getOrder(id: OrderId): Order {
  // ...
}

// The caller has to do this:
getOrder(order.id as OrderId);
// Or this:
getOrder({ value: order.id } as OrderId);

// Both are friction. The compiler was never going to confuse
// `OrderId` with `CustomerId` if there is only one id type.
```

When the codebase has only one identifier per domain value
(`OrderId` and nothing else), the primitive is the right shape.
The brand would be ceremony without value. The right move is:

```ts
// Just use the primitive. The type name is the contract.
function getOrder(id: string): Order {
  // ...
}

getOrder(order.id);
```

The brand is justified only when the codebase has **two or more
IDs of the same primitive type that must not be confused**. The
moment a second ID appears (`OrderId` and `CustomerId` next to
each other in a transfer function, say), the brand becomes the
cheapest way to tell them apart at compile time.

The branded type has the same runtime shape as `string`, but the
type system distinguishes them. The consumer cannot swap
`AccountId` and `CustomerId`; the compiler refuses.

## The four patterns

The codebase uses four patterns for domain types, in increasing
order of expressiveness.

- **Branded type** (identifier, scalar): `type AccountId = string & {
readonly __brand: 'AccountId' }`. Same runtime shape as the
  primitive; the type system prevents mix-ups. Use when the value
  is a single string or number with no internal structure.
- **Record type** (shape with fields): `type Message = { readonly
content: string; readonly type: 'text' | 'image' }`. Use when the
  value has internal structure the domain cares about.
- **Discriminated union**: `type Event = { kind: 'click'; x: number;
y: number } | { kind: 'key'; key: string }`. Use when the value
  has multiple shapes the consumer switches on.
- **Branded record** (identifier with metadata): `type UserId = {
readonly value: string; readonly tenantId: string }`. Use when
  the identifier carries metadata the domain cares about.

The pattern is chosen by **what the value carries**, not by
preference. A `UserId` that is just a string gets the branded
pattern; a `UserId` that carries tenant info gets the branded
record. A `Message` with content and type gets the record; an
`Event` with multiple shapes gets the discriminated union.

## When the rule does not apply

The rule applies to **values that participate in the domain**.
It does not apply to:

- **Truly local values** that never escape a single function.
  `function double(n: number)` is fine; the consumer never sees
  `n`.
- **Built-in primitive usages** that the language requires —
  `Array.prototype.length` is `number`; `string.length` is `number`;
  iteration indices are `number`. The rule is about domain values,
  not language-level primitives.
- **Boundary conversions**. When JSON is parsed, the parser returns
  `string`; the conversion to `Message` happens immediately
  after. The conversion is the boundary.
- **Algorithm-internal values** that the algorithm never exposes.
  A `Stack<T>` may use `T[]` internally; the public `Stack<T>`
  type hides the array.

## The conversion at the boundary

The conversion from primitive to domain type happens **once**, at
the boundary where the value enters the system. After conversion,
the rest of the codebase uses the domain type. The conversion
function is named for the domain concept, not the primitive:

```ts
// Bad — the parser returns string; the rest of the codebase uses string.
function parseNotification(raw: string): string {
  // ...
}

// Good — the parser returns the domain type; the rest of the
// codebase sees the shape.
function parseNotification(raw: string): Message {
  // ...validate, then construct the typed value.
  return { content: '...', type: 'text' };
}

// And the conversion function lives next to the type:
function parseUserId(raw: string): UserId {
  if (!isValidUserId(raw)) {
    throw new InvalidUserIdError(raw);
  }
  return { value: raw };
}
```

The conversion function **validates the contract** that the
primitive cannot. A `parseUserId` rejects strings that are not
valid user-ids; the rest of the codebase never has to check.

## What this looks like in violation

Three shapes that this rule exists to catch.

The first, primitive as a function parameter:

```ts
// Bad — what is the difference between the three strings?
function createUser(name: string, email: string, password: string): User {
  // ...
}
```

Three strings, one type. The compiler cannot tell which argument
is which; the reader has to read the call sites to know.

The second, primitive as a function return type:

```ts
// Bad — what does this string mean?
function getUserId(user: User): string {
  // ...
}
```

The return type is `string`. The consumer receives a string. The
consumer does not know whether this string is the user-id, the
username, or the email. The fix is `function getUserId(user: User):
UserId`.

The third, primitive in a data structure:

```ts
// Bad — three strings in one shape.
type Notification = {
  readonly message: string;
  readonly sender: string;
  readonly recipient: string;
};
```

A `Notification` with three strings is a shape where the consumer
cannot tell the fields apart. The fix is to make each field a
domain type:

```ts
type Notification = {
  readonly message: Message;
  readonly sender: UserId;
  readonly recipient: UserId;
};
```

The shape is the same shape at runtime; the type system now
refuses to mix the three.

## What senior practitioners say

Goldberg captures the structural-typing limitation. Two strings
are the same to the compiler; the brand is what makes them
different. The rule's branded-type pattern is Goldberg's pattern.

Ferreira captures the **time dimension** of the rule. The bare
primitive compiles today; the bug appears six months later when
the consumer has forgotten the convention. The domain type
**shifts the error to compile time**, which is the only time the
author can catch it.

Foth captures the **reader's economy**. A primitive that is aliased
to a domain type still reads as a primitive to the consumer; the
alias adds nothing. A domain-specific type adds the **shape** the
domain cares about, and the shape is what the reader sees.

The three sources converge on the operational rule: primitives
are the **wrong level of abstraction** for any value the domain
treats as a concept. The right level is a type the domain owns.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a `string` or `number` in a
  public function signature, a return type, or a data structure
  blocks the PR and asks for the domain type.
- **Lint rule** (future). A custom ESLint rule can flag function
  parameters typed as primitives when the parameter name is a
  domain concept (`message`, `recipient`, `amount` without a
  custom type). The rule's existence is the enforcement signal
  even before it is automated.
- **Quarterly audit**. A standing review of "what primitives
  cross module boundaries in this codebase?" surfaces the
  candidates that slipped through.

## Exceptions

Built-in language primitives are exempt: `Array.prototype.length`
is `number`; iteration indices are `number`. The rule applies to
**domain** primitives.

A truly local value that never escapes a function is exempt. The
point of the rule is the **boundary** and the **consumer**; local
values have neither.

A boundary conversion is exempt: the conversion function
**accepts** the primitive. The conversion produces the domain
type. After the conversion, the primitive is gone from the
codebase's vocabulary.

Algorithm-internal primitives are exempt. A `Stack<T>` may use
`T[]` internally; the public type hides the array. The internals
of an algorithm are not the boundary.
