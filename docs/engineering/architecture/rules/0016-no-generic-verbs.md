# 0016 — No Generic Verbs

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

A function name's verb must answer three questions:

1. **What transformation does it perform?** (`decode` is the
   inverse of `encode`; `parse` takes a string and returns a
   parsed value; `validate` checks a condition.)
2. **What does it return?** (`decodeJwt` returns a `Jwt`;
   `parseUserId` returns a `UserId`; `validateAge` returns a
   boolean.)
3. **What is the contract on the input?** (`parse` accepts a
   `string` of a specific format; `decode` accepts an `Encoded` of
   a specific algorithm.)

The verbs `parse`, `convert`, `validate`, `transform`, `handle`,
`process`, `do`, `make`, `perform`, `manage`
fail at least one of the three questions. They are **generic
verbs**: they say "I do something" without saying what. The rule
refuses them as the verb of a function name when a more specific
verb is available.

The verbs `run` and `execute` sit in a different category. They
_can_ be specific when the function's contract is the orchestration
itself (see "When the rule does not apply" below: `runPipeline`,
`executeSteps`). They are excluded from the generic-verb blacklist
on that basis; the exception below is the canonical place to
evaluate them.

When no specific verb is available, the rule says: **do not
write the function**. A function whose verb is `process` is a
function whose author did not yet understand what the function
does. Understanding the function is a prerequisite for naming it;
naming it `process` is the symptom of a missing understanding.

## Why

A generic verb is a **promise without content**. The function
exists; the author wrote it; the name says only "this function
runs". The reader who meets the function knows nothing new from
the name. The reader must read the body to recover the intent —
when the body could be skipped if the name carried the intent.

The deeper problem is **epistemic**: the author who wrote
`processMessage` did not yet know what the function did. They
reached for the generic verb because they had no other name to
reach for. The name is a confession: the author named the function
before they understood the function.

A specific verb is a **claim of understanding**. `decodeJwt` says
the author knew the function takes an encoded JWT and returns a
decoded one. `parseUserId` says the author knew the function takes
a raw string and returns a validated `UserId`. The verb carries
the contract.

## What this looks like in violation

The bad shape, generic verb that says nothing:

```ts
// Bad — what does this function do?
function processMessage(message: Message): void {
  // ...
}

// Bad — what does this convert?
function convert(input: Input): Output {
  // ...
}

// Bad — what does this handle?
function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response): void {
  // ...
}

// Bad — what does this validate?
function validate(value: string): void {
  // ...
}
```

Each name is a placeholder. The author reached for a verb when
they did not have a specific verb to use. The body of each
function is where the work lives; the body is where the reader
must go to recover the intent that the name should have carried.

The right shape, specific verb that says what:

```ts
// Good — the verb says the transformation, the return type says
// the result.
function decodeJwt(token: EncodedJwt): Jwt {
  // ...
}

// Good — parse says "raw string in, parsed value out"; the return
// type says which parsed value.
function parseUserId(raw: string): UserId {
  if (!isValidUserIdFormat(raw)) {
    throw new InvalidUserIdError(raw);
  }
  return { value: raw };
}

// Good — send is the operation; the return type says the
// acknowledgement.
function sendNotification(message: Message, recipient: UserId): NotificationAck {
  // ...
}

// Good — handle is generic; what the handler does is the verb.
function onOrderCancelled(order: Order): void {
  // Mark the order as cancelled, refund the customer, notify them.
}
```

Each verb is specific. Each return type names the result. The
reader knows what the function does from the name.

## The test for a good verb

Before committing a function name, ask four questions:

1. **Can the reader tell what the function does from the name
   alone?** If not, the verb is generic.
2. **Is the return type the answer to "what does this function
   produce"?** If not, the function does too many things; split
   it.
3. **Is the input type the answer to "what does this function
   accept"?** If not, the function accepts too many things;
   narrow the input.
4. **Could a reader write a unit test for this function without
   reading the body?** If the test requires reading the body to
   know what to assert, the name is not specific enough.

A "no" to any question is a signal to rename.

## When the rule does not apply

The rule refuses generic verbs as **the verb of a function name**.
It does not refuse:

- **Generic verbs inside a function body** — a comment, a log
  message, an error message. `// process the message before
sending` is fine in a comment; the comment does not have to
  carry the contract.
- **Generic verbs as nouns** — `handleRequest` as a class name is
  a different smell (rule 0013). The rule here is about the
  verb of a function.
- **Truly generic operations** — a function whose job is genuinely
  "do several things in order" may be named `runPipeline` or
  `executeSteps` if the steps are not the function's contract;
  the function delegates to named helpers. _This is why `run`
  and `execute` are not in the blacklist at the top of the
  rule: the orchestrator's contract is the order of the steps,
  and the verb names the order. A function called `run` (or
  `execute`) on a single step is back in the violation case
  above; a function called `runPipeline` is the legitimate
  shape._

## What senior practitioners say

The Karlton joke becomes operational in this rule: the hardest
problem in computer science is naming, and generic verbs are the
easiest way to fail at it.

> "Forbidden words in identifiers: do, make, handle, perform,
> something. They are so generic. An operation will do something
> by definition. So you should not mention that. Make is double
> the characters without conveying any more meaning."

Lübke's forbidden list is the operational form of the rule.
This rule extends Lübke's list with the function-name-specific
verbs that are common in this codebase: `parse`, `convert`,
`validate`, `transform`.

> "Parse, don't validate. [...] Returning `Maybe` is undoubtedly
> convenient when we're implementing `head`. However, it becomes
> significantly less convenient when we want to actually use it!
> [...] The burden falls upon its callers to handle that
> possibility."
>
> — Alexis King, _Parse, don't validate_, November 2019.

King's principle, applied to naming: a function called `validate`
returns `boolean`; the caller must handle the case where the
boolean is `false`. A function called `parse` returns the parsed
value; the caller does not handle the negative case (the parse
function throws). The verb encodes the contract.

> "An `AutoMakersList : List<String>` adds complexity without
> adding information. [...] The list is still of `string`, and
> the last time I checked, there were no validation methods on
> `string` that validate they are auto maker's names."
>
> — Andrew Theken, _The "Named Generic" Anti-pattern_, June 2010.

Theken targets types; this rule targets verbs. Both are instances
of the same principle: a name that adds zero information is a
smell, whether it is a class name or a function name.

The four sources converge on the operational rule: a function
name's verb must encode the transformation, the return type must
encode the result. Generic verbs fail both tests.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees a generic verb (`process`,
  `convert`, `validate`, `transform`, `handle`) in a function
  name blocks the PR and asks for a specific verb.
- **Naming audit**. A standing review of "which function names in
  this codebase use a generic verb?" surfaces the candidates that
  slipped through. Each is a rename candidate.
- **Lint rule** (future). A custom ESLint rule can flag function
  names that match a list of generic verbs. The rule's existence
  is the enforcement signal even before it is automated.

## Exceptions

A function whose job is genuinely "do several things in order"
may use a verb that names the orchestration (`runPipeline`,
`executeSteps`) when the function's contract is the order, not the
work. The work is done by named helpers; the function delegates.
The rule is not against orchestration verbs; it is against
naming-without-understanding.

A test or fixture name may use a generic verb (`setupTest`,
`createFixture`) because the test's contract is "set up state",
not "do domain work". The rule applies to production code; test
code is exempt.

  a function whose verb is `process` is a function whose algorithm
  is not named. Rule 0005 captures the algorithm naming;
  rule 0016 captures the verb naming.
- **Rule 0013** — Entity-First Naming: a class named `Handler`
  is the noun-level equivalent of a function named `handle*`. The
  two rules compound; the suffix smell and the verb smell are
  instances of the same "named generic" anti-pattern.
- **Rule 0015** — Domain-Specific Types Over Primitives: a generic
  verb often pairs with a primitive return type. `processMessage`
  returns `void`; the verb is generic because the return is
  generic. The fix for both is the same: pick a specific verb and
  a specific type.
