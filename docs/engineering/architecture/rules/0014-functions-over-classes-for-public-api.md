# 0014 — Functions Over Classes for Public API

**Status**: Active (enforced through code review).
**Date**: 2026-08-11.

## Rule

The public API of this codebase exposes **functions**, not
classes. A class is a **detail of internal implementation** that
the consumer never instantiates, never inspects with `instanceof`,
never extends, and never imports by name.

Concretely:

- **An export is a function** (or a type, or an `Object.freeze`'d
  value). A class is **not** an export.
- **A consumer creates an entity by calling a function**:
  `const group = createGroup(...)`, not `const group = new Group(...)`.
- **The consumer sees the type of the constructed entity**, not
  the class. The class is a private symbol; the type is public.

This rule applies to **public API**. Inside a module, classes are
permitted when they are the right shape for state — a `Stack`, an
`Error`, an `Event`, a `Group` — because the class encapsulates
mutable state more cleanly than a closure. The rule is about what
**crosses the module boundary**.

## Why

A class is a **template** for an object. The consumer has the
template in hand. With the template, the consumer can:

- Create other instances by `extends`, with logic the author did not
  anticipate.
- Override methods by inheritance, replacing behaviour the author
  tested.
- Reach into private state with `as any` casts, breaking the
  invariants the author maintained.
- Couple their code to method names the author may want to rename
  in a future version.

Each of these is a freedom the consumer did not need and the
author did not want to grant. Every API surface is a contract; a
class is a contract that includes the freedom to break it.

A function is a contract that does not include those freedoms.
The consumer calls it; they get back a value of a public type;
they cannot reach into the implementation. The function is the
boundary. The class, if any, is behind it.

## What this looks like in practice

The bad shape, class as public API:

```ts
// Bad — the consumer can `new Group(...)`, extend it, override its
// methods, or cast it to access private state.
export class Group {
  private members: Member[] = [];

  add(member: Member): void {
    this.members.push(member);
  }

  // ...
}

export function group(): Group {
  return new Group();
}
```

The consumer receives a `Group` reference. They can do
`new Group()`, `class MyGroup extends Group`, `group() as any` to
access `members`. Every API change risks breaking them. The
factory function adds nothing here; the class is the API.

The right shape, function as public API:

```ts
// Good — the consumer sees `Group` as a type, not a class.
// They cannot instantiate it, extend it, or reach into it.
class Group {
  #members: Member[] = [];

  add(member: Member): void {
    this.#members.push(member);
  }

  // ...
}

export type Group = ReturnType<typeof createGroup>;

export function createGroup(): Group {
  const instance = new Group();
  // ...
  return instance;
}

// Or: `function group(): Group` as the public constructor.
```

The consumer sees `Group` as a type. They call `createGroup()` or
`group()` and get back a value of that type. The class itself is
not exported; the consumer cannot `new Group()` because the symbol
is not in scope. The factory function is the **only** entry point.

## When the rule does not apply

The rule applies to **exports**. It does not apply to:

- **Internal classes** within a module. A class that is created
  inside a file and only ever returned through a factory function
  is fine.
- **Classes that are genuinely host types** — when augmenting a
  host type (Express request, Error subclass), the host already
  chose `class`; the project follows.
- **Built-in classes** — `Error`, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `URL`,
  `URLSearchParams`. These are language-standard classes; the rule
  does not apply.
- **Test files**, where a class is the natural shape for a test
  fixture.
- **Frameworks that require classes** — a decorator-based framework
  where the @Injectable() pattern requires a class is not negotiable;
  the framework dictates the shape.

## Why a class at all, then?

A class is the right shape for **mutable state with a clear
identity**. A `Stack<T>` that supports `push`, `pop`, and `peek`
has state (the items) and identity (the order). A closure-based
factory that returns `{ push, pop, peek }` works but the state is
buried in a closure the reader has to mentally unwrap. A class
makes the state visible.

A class is also the right shape for **inheritance the project
controls**. The project owns the class; no consumer extends it;
the class exists to give the project a clear shape for state and
behaviour. The factory function is the boundary; the class is
behind it.

A class is **not** the right shape for:

- A pure function (no state).
- A pure value (no behaviour).
- A namespace of related functions (use a module).
- An API the consumer is expected to instantiate, extend, or
  customise.

## The factory function pattern

A factory function in this codebase has three properties:

1. **It is the only export that constructs the entity.** A
   consumer cannot reach the class through any other path.
2. **It returns a typed value.** The return type is the public
   shape; the class is hidden.
3. **It does not leak the class symbol.** The class is declared
   inside the file or inside a private submodule. It is not
   re-exported. It is not referenced in the public types.

Example:

```ts
// group.ts

// Internal: never exported.
class GroupImpl {
  #members: Member[] = [];

  add(member: Member): void {
    this.#members.push(member);
  }
}

// Public: the type the consumer sees.
export type Group = {
  add(member: Member): void;
};

// Public: the only constructor.
export function group(): Group {
  const impl = new GroupImpl();
  return {
    add: impl.add.bind(impl),
  };
}
```

The consumer imports `group` (the function) and `Group` (the
type). They cannot import `GroupImpl` because it is not exported.
They cannot `new Group()` because `Group` is a type, not a class.
They cannot extend the implementation because they have no
reference to it.

For richer entities, the implementation may export a class name
that is the public **type** while keeping the constructor
private. TypeScript supports this pattern:

```ts
class GroupImpl {
  // ...
}

// Public type: same name, no runtime entity.
// Consumers see Group as the type, not the constructor.
export type Group = GroupImpl;

// Public constructor.
export function group(): Group {
  return new GroupImpl();
}
```

Here `Group` is a type alias to `GroupImpl`. The consumer sees the
type but cannot construct it directly because `GroupImpl` is not
exported. The constructor is `group()`, not `new Group()`.

## What this looks like in violation

Three shapes that this rule exists to catch.

The first, class as the only export:

```ts
// Bad — the consumer imports the class and instantiates it.
export class ErrorHandler {
  // ...
}
```

The consumer can `new ErrorHandler(...)`, extend it, override
methods. Every API change risks breaking them.

The second, class plus factory, but the class is also exported:

```ts
// Bad — the factory is just sugar; the class is still reachable.
export class ErrorHandler {
  // ...
}
export function createErrorHandler(): ErrorHandler {
  return new ErrorHandler();
}
```

The consumer can still `import { ErrorHandler }` and `new
ErrorHandler(...)`. The factory adds an entry point; it does not
remove the old one. The fix is to drop `export` from the class.

The third, class exported for "convenience":

```ts
// Bad — the author thought the consumer would want both.
// They don't. Pick one (the function).
export class Group {
  // ...
}
export const createGroup = (): Group => new Group();
```

Two paths to the same thing. The consumer uses one or the other;
both ship; both are supported. The fix is to drop the class
export and the constructor becomes the function.

Abamov's position is the strictest among the senior sources and
the one this rule follows. The class is a detail of internal
implementation; the API is the function.

> "When using factory function, only the methods we expose are
> public, everything else is encapsulated."

Salcescu operationalises Abamov with the encapsulation argument.
A factory function closes by default; a class opens by default.
The rule picks the closed default because the consumer never needs
the open one.

> "Don't expect people to use your classes. Even if you choose
> to provide your classes as a public API, prefer duck typing

The duck-typing corollary: the function's input type does not
require `instanceof ClassName`. It accepts anything that has the
methods the function calls. The class is the implementation; the
type is the contract.

The three positions converge on the operational rule: classes
are for state, functions are for API. The rule applies the
position to this codebase's exports.

## Enforcement

- **Code review**. A reviewer who sees `export class` in any file
  blocks the PR. The class is fine if it is internal; it is not
  fine if it is exported.
- **Lint rule** (future). A custom ESLint rule can flag any
  `export class` declaration. The rule's existence is the
  enforcement signal even before it is automated.
- **Public API audit**. A standing review of "what classes does
  this codebase export?" returns an empty list. A non-empty list
  is a release-blocking finding.

## Exceptions

A built-in class is exempt: `Error`, `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, `URL`,
`Promise`, etc. The project does not own these; the rule does
not apply.

A framework-mandated class is exempt: a decorator-based DI
container requires a class; the framework dictates the shape; the
rule does not fight the framework.

A test class is exempt: tests are internal to the project; they
are not consumed by the public.

A genuinely public type whose construction is fixed by a host
(e.g. a framework's `Request`) is exempt: the project augments
the host; the augmentation is `interface`, not `class`.

  carves out `interface` for declaration merging, open-shape
  class implementation, and host augmentation. When rule 0012
  permits an `interface` because a class implements an open
  shape (the "library extension point" pattern), that class is
  internal per this rule; the public contract is the `interface`,
  the public constructor is the factory function, the class is
  behind the boundary.
- **Rule 0013** — Entity-First Naming: the factory function is
  the natural name for the **action** that produces the entity
  (`group`, `createGroup`, `cancelOrder`). The class is the
  entity behind the action; the action is what the consumer calls.
- **Rule 0001** — Project Mindset: invariant 9 ("optimise for
  the reader") is the philosophical ground of the rule. The

  The reader of an exported class sees the contract plus the
  freedom to break it.
- **Rule 0006** — Technology Choices: the function-based API
  surface is one of the explicit choices the codebase commits to.
  Adding a class is a change to that commitment, not a local
  refactor.
